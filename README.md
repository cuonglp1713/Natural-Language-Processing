<p>This is a simple model for processing natural language use to predict the SMS spam filter:</p>
<p>1. Using stopwords from nltk library to remove common words</p>
<p>2. Using Vectorizer to pre-processing data</p>
<p>3. Using MultinomialNB from Naive Bayes from Scikit-Learn to train, predict and evaluate the model</p>
<p>Data Pipeline is added on to store a pipeline of workflow.</p>
